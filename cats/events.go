// The event stream: the one control-socket call that does not close after a
// reply. events.subscribe gets an ack response, then Event frames on the same
// connection until somebody hangs up — so GoNotes learns that the host's theme
// changed, or that a sibling agent went from working to blocked, without
// polling for any of it.
//
// THE STREAM MUST SURVIVE A CATS RESTART. This is the difference between the
// stream and every other call in this package: a unary call that fails is a
// feature that didn't happen, but a subscription that fails silently is a
// feature that stops working forever and never says so. The reader loop
// therefore reconnects with capped exponential backoff, indefinitely, until
// Close — a cats that comes back up five minutes later is picked up
// automatically.
//
// Three rules the loop keeps, each one a bug it would otherwise be:
//
//  1. NO READ DEADLINE once subscribed. Events are sparse — minutes can pass
//     between them — so a deadline would turn an idle stream into a
//     reconnect loop. The handshake IS bounded; only the pump is not.
//  2. The callback runs on the READER goroutine and must not touch model
//     state. It is expected to do exactly one thing: post a typed message onto
//     the Bubble Tea event loop. See tui/cats_glue.go.
//  3. Close must interrupt a blocked read, which closing the connection is
//     the only way to do. The live connection is therefore held under a
//     mutex so Close can reach it.
