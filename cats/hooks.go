// The hook reporter: how GoNotes tells cats what it is doing, so cats can
// badge the pane, raise a toast, or push to a phone when a long-running edit
// finishes — the same channel the coding-agent hooks use, and the reason
// GoNotes gets that whole notification story for ~150 lines rather than by
// growing a notifier of its own.
//
// This is a DIFFERENT socket from the control API (CATS_SOCKET_PATH, not
// CATS_CONTROL_SOCKET) with a different envelope, so it is available even
// when the control socket is not — a distinction worth keeping, because the
// attention story is the one that matters when you are not looking at the
// screen. It is also why the reporter is armed from the environment alone,
// before the control-socket probe has answered.
//
// Three design points:
//
//   - SOURCE IS "gonotes", A CUSTOM SOURCE. The reserved "cats:<agent>"
//     sources (cats:claude, cats:codex …) have their state driven by cats' own
//     process detection, and a hook claiming one of those names gets its
//     state ignored. GoNotes is not one of those agents, so it takes an
//     unreserved name and receives real state authority for its pane.
//   - SEQ IS ALLOCATED AT CALL TIME, NOT AT SEND TIME, AND IS SEEDED FROM
//     THE CLOCK. Reports are sent on their own goroutines, so two of them
//     can reach the socket out of order; the server keeps a per-source
//     high-water mark and drops anything stale. Stamping the number in
//     ReportState — on the Bubble Tea event loop, in the order the transitions
//     actually happened — is what makes that mechanism protect us instead of
//     a race we lose at random. The seed matters just as much: the
//     high-water mark lives on the PANE and outlives this process, so a
//     counter starting at 1 would have every report from a re-launched
//     GoNotes in the same pane silently dropped as stale.
//   - SENDING IS FIRE AND FORGET. The reply is not read and failures are not
//     surfaced. A hook socket that is gone, wedged, or belongs to a cats that
//     forgot this pane must cost GoNotes nothing at all; there is no
//     user-facing decision that a failed status report could inform.
