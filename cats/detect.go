// Package cats is GoNotes' client for the cats terminal multiplexer it may be
// running inside: the control socket (one JSON request per line, one response
// back), the event stream that socket can be upgraded to, and the separate
// hook socket a pane program reports its state on.
//
// It is stdlib only, and it obeys two house rules:
//
//   - NO UI STATE. Nothing in here touches the Bubble Tea model. Background
//     goroutines hand results to callbacks whose only job is to post a typed
//     message onto the event loop (Program.Send); the root Update is the sole
//     mutator. See tui/cats_glue.go.
//   - SILENT DEGRADATION. Every failure — not inside cats, socket missing,
//     socket dead, cats restarted, protocol mismatch — ends at Tier 0, where
//     GoNotes behaves exactly as it does in any other terminal. No feature may
//     exist only at Tier 1.
//
// THE WIRE STRUCTS ARE HAND-COPIED MIRRORS of cats' own
// (internal/app/command_vocab.go, internal/app/events.go,
// cmd/catway/hooks.go), deliberately minimal — only the fields GoNotes reads
// or sends. GoNotes must NOT import the cats module: it has to stay buildable
// and installable on a machine that has never heard of cats, and a shared type
// package would make the note-taking app's build depend on the multiplexer's.
//
// Detection is split in two on purpose:
//
//	DetectEnv()  reads four env vars. No IO, so startup can call it inline.
//	Caps.Probe() dials the control socket and pings. Milliseconds when the
//	             socket is live or absent, but a wedged listener could hold
//	             it for ProbeTimeout — so the TUI runs it as a tea.Cmd and
//	             lets the answer arrive as a message.
